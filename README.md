For guidance on node testing I used [this][nodejs-testing-essentials] article and
later rewired the whole thing using [this][tools-for-unit-testing-and-quality-assurance-in-node-js] article

Mongodb pub/sub feature is not a new thing. Following [this][pub-sub-with-mongodb] article made me realize how easy it is. Now why should I use mongodb for a purpose redis can handle so well? Less infrastructure for one. I guess tailable cursors will have some kind o persistance redis pub/sub lucks.
